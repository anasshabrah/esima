  "faqSection.faq1.answer": "No, one eSIM can only be installed on a single device. Additionally, most eSIMs can only be installed once.",
  "faqSection.faq1.question": "Can I install one eSIM on several devices?",
  "faqSection.faq10.answer": "Hundreds of millions, if not billions. 32 million were shipped in 2020 in Western Europe alone. Samsung shipped more than 200 million worldwide in 2020. eSIM shipments grew 83% in 2020 and eSIM profile downloads increased 300% over the same period. eSIM service is commercially available for more than 2 billion mobile users.",
  "faqSection.faq10.question": "How many mobile devices out there support eSIM?",
  "faqSection.faq11.answer": "Really easy. All eSIM-enabled phones have been designed to allow users to make use of their capabilities and prevent them accidentally configuring their phone the wrong way.",
  "faqSection.faq11.question": "How easy is it to switch between multiple SIM profiles?",
  "faqSection.faq12.answer": "Just a few changes to the phone settings that all eSIM-enabled phones support with ease. eSIM Go enables data bundles to be ‘pushed’ to a phone user simply by scanning a QR code. From purchase to installed and active in as little as 30 seconds.",
  "faqSection.faq12.question": "How do you add data bundles to an eSIM?",
  "faqSection.faq13.answer": "Not if they don’t want to. The most popular application for eSIM is to attach data bundles from different providers depending on what offers are available on the market and what you need to do (e.g. travel internationally). In these instances, there is no extra phone number – just access for the phone onto superfast cellular networks.",
  "faqSection.faq13.question": "Does having more than one eSIM profile mean the user must have more than one phone number?",
  "faqSection.faq14.answer": "Unless you're a mobile operator or dedicated MVNO, physical SIM cards have made offering mobile data services challenging. Now, travel and hospitality brands can leverage eSIM technology to boost customer value, transaction frequency, and provide seamless multi-network data access that enhances other travel services.",
  "faqSection.faq14.question": "What advantages does eSIM give now that SIM cards didn’t before?",
  "faqSection.faq15.answer": "Voice/SMS services will still work unless the user changes their phone settings. The phone allows users to set primary and secondary SIMs, making it easy to manage calls, SMS, and data preferences.",
  "faqSection.faq15.question": "What happens to a phone’s voice/SMS services if an eSIM data bundle from another operator is added?",
  "faqSection.faq2.answer": "Any unused data will expire after the eSIM’s validity period ends and cannot be used. However, if the eSIM is rechargeable, you may be able to add a top-up bundle or package.",
  "faqSection.faq2.question": "What happens to unused data?",
  "faqSection.faq3.answer": "This error typically appears if your device is network-locked. To use eSIMs, your device must be network-unlocked.",
  "faqSection.faq3.question": "Why am I seeing the error message 'Cellular Bundles From This Carrier Cannot be Added'?",
  "faqSection.faq4.answer": "You will need to contact your mobile carrier to unlock your device. If it was recently unlocked, eSIM support may be temporarily disabled by the carrier for security reasons.",
  "faqSection.faq4.question": "What should I do if my device is network locked?",
  "faqSection.faq5.answer": "All of our bundles are sold with autostart enabled, meaning the bundle will automatically begin as soon as it connects to a supported network with data roaming enabled. It is not currently possible to specify a start date or time for the bundle.",
  "faqSection.faq5.question": "How does Autostart and Autorenew work?",
  "faqSection.faq6.answer": "Whilst we are aiming to offer eSIMs compatible on wearable devices in future, we do not currently support this with our technology. Our eSIMs are supported on Mobiles, Tablets, and Laptops.",
  "faqSection.faq6.question": "Will my eSIM work in a Smart Watch?",
  "faqSection.faq7.answer": "Most eSIMs are data only, thus you won’t be able to send an SMS or make a phone call through them. However, internet-based messaging and calling services can be accessed using the mobile data provided by your eSIM.",
  "faqSection.faq7.question": "Can I send SMS or make phone calls using my eSIM?",
  "faqSection.faq8.answer": "Your eSIM places no restrictions on accessing websites and applications. However, some banking websites and applications may be inaccessible due to security protocols, proxy settings, and local restrictions in the region.",
  "faqSection.faq8.question": "Are any websites or applications blocked or restricted using eSIM data?",
  "faqSection.faq9.answer": "You can continue using the same eSIM if: you're in a country supported by the eSIM, the eSIM is installed, and you buy a data top-up package or a top-up pack. If no options to add a top-up bundle appear, the eSIM is a single-use eSIM. You don’t have to delete it if you intend to use it later; just turn it off under Cellular data bundles.",
  "faqSection.faq9.question": "Can I keep using the same eSIM?",
